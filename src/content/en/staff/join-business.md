### 1. Get a Staff Invitation Code
To get a staff invitation code, the business owner must first create an invitation through the staff menu in either the Kelola Android app or Kelola Web version. Or read the article [How to Invite Staff](../staff/invite-staff)

### 2. Create a Kelola Account
As a staff member, you'll need to register for a Kelola account first. You can download the Kelola app at [kelola.co](https://kelola.co). Then sign up using your Google account.

### 3. Choose Join Business
After successfully registering, click the **Join Business** button. Enter the invitation code sent by the business owner who invited you. Please note that the code is case-sensitive.

### 4. Complete
If you enter the correct code, you'll automatically join as a staff member of that business. You'll only be able to perform activities that have been authorized by the business owner.
