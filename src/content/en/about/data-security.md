Kelola.co utilizes cloud-based data storage for all its operations. This means that all your data, including financial records, transactions, and other information, is stored on internet-connected servers rather than solely on your local devices (such as smartphones or laptops).

This cloud-based storage system helps protect against data loss that might occur due to lost or damaged devices.
