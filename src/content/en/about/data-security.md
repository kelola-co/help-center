Kelola.co utilizes a modern and secure cloud-based data storage system. Every piece of data you enter - from financial records and transactions to other important information - is automatically stored on our protected servers, not just on your device.

Key benefits of our cloud system:
- Your data remains secure even if devices are lost or damaged
- Access financial information from any device
- Regular automatic backups

As an independent platform, Kelola.co has no affiliations with banks, fintech companies, or any financial institutions. We are fully committed to protecting your privacy - your financial information will never be shared or sold to third parties. This independence allows us to focus entirely on one thing: protecting and managing your financial data with the highest security standards.
