## Understanding Stock In, Out, and Audit

Kelola.co offers three key inventory management features: Stock In, Stock Out, and Audit. Here's how each feature works:

### Stock In
Stock In records items added to your business inventory, typically from vendor purchases. This feature allows you to:

- Record new items purchased from vendors
- Increase available warehouse stock quantities
- Track purchase details including cost, vendor information, and receipt dates

### Stock Out
Stock Out tracks items leaving your inventory through sales or other channels. Use this feature to:

- Record sold or removed items
- Decrease available warehouse stock quantities
- Log transaction details including selling price, buyer information, and transaction dates

### Audit
Audit verifies physical inventory against system records. This feature helps you:

- Compare actual stock levels with system data
- Adjust final stock quantities when discrepancies occur
- Correct input errors from previous stock transactions

These features work together to help business owners maintain accurate inventory levels, prevent stock shortages or surpluses, and ensure inventory data remains precise.
